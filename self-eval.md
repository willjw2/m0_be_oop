# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
> It felt decent, having to go outside of what was explicitly taught felt a little uncomfortable, i guess, but not really outside what I'm used to doing at this point.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
> Honestly just ran through this entire lesson in one go without breaks and managed to stay focused, as I'm kind of just looking to get to the weekend at this point.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
> I think I'll just need to get used to the duration more so than the intensity in order to get ready, I think I'd need to prepare with the mindset that I need to remember to take breaks and remember to stay hydrated/eat snacks.
